My first real application... fingers crossed it doesnt blow up!

I made this budgetting application using Ruby (only god knows why), for a real world use.  
I used this application in my job to help the young people I support visualize their money and to help them budget.  
It has the ability to create values of expenses, read current expenses, update and delete expenses.
